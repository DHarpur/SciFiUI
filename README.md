# SciFiUI
## Sci-Fi User Interface for 2nd Year Programming 

### Controls

  -> 'W' key to bring up the warp menu.
  
  -> Left and right arrow keys to naviggate the menu.
  
  -> Enter key to select each option on the menu.

### The Interface
  
  In this assignemnt I decided to create a Star Trek inspired user interface which allowed the user to 'warp' to different locations. Eg. Vulcan or Romulus. Once the user successfully selects a planet to 'warp' to, a warp animation is immplemented. When the animation is complete and the user has arrived at their next destination, an audio clip related to that specific planet is played. It is the implementation of the audio that I am most proud of.
